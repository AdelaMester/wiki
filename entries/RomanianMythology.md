**Tales and legends**

Romanian mythology can be truly impressive,
with tales of giants that protected the Earth,
and powerful wizards that descended from 
Dacian High Priests. 

**Jidovi - The Carpathian Giants**
The legends of many nations describe a bygone era when the world was ruled by giant humans. Some sources claim that this legendary era is not at all a story and that those giants indeed ruled the world at some point in time. Even if they did or did not exist, they left us beautiful stories about their way of living.

 

The Romanian Giants known as Jidovi, are probably one of the most beloved folklore creatures. Jidovii are described in Romanian legends as kind and patient, walking with huge steps from one hill to another. Their presence in Romania is well maintained by the multitude of places that were named after them: the Jidovi table, the Jidovi cave, the hill or the tombs of Jidovi, and also, there is jidovina, a measuring unit consisting of several meters, the equivalent of a giant’s step. Wherever you go, their memory is well preserved and you must not be surprised to hear that there are still many people who believe in their past existence.
In the Carpathians, Jidovii are often named Blajini, which means the Kind Ones, or Novaci, which means the Powerful Ones as they could snatch a tree without any effort. They lived in caves and thick woods, enjoyed talking and respected the little humans, which they considered their successors, the next owners of all the rivers and mountains.

At the beginning of 1900, there were still some people who claimed to have heard real stories about Jidovi from their grandparents who saw them in person. According to their stories, there were few giants left but lived in good communion with humans. When great floods came, Jidovii took care of people and their animals without asking for any reward.

 

Also, there is a story which repeats regardless of region, when giants seeing people plowing the land, took them in their hands as little toys, smiled at them and then put them back carefully. But the best legend ever is that of the famous agreement between the great Dacian king Burebista and all the Jidovi from the mountains. They were left to live in the mountains only if they promised to guard with their life the great Dacian gold treasures. So, it is believed, that in the deepest caves of the Carpathians Mountains may still live some Jidovi, protecting the treasures for generations to come.

**The Legendary Baba Dochia - The return of spring**

There is no Romanian who hasn’t heard at least once the legends of Dochia. Sometimes presented in the form of a beautiful girl, other times in the appearance of an old lady, Dochia is probably one of the most known legendary figures.
In Romania, the days at the beginning of March are considered days of a new beginning or Baba Dochia's Day. So, before the 1st of March, especially women use to choose one day from the first 9 and judging by how the weather is on the chosen day, they know how the new year will be for them.

**Romanian mythology about the Fates**

The legend says that the Fates are actually three Iele with special gifts. The first Fate, called Ursitoarea, is the oldest and the tallest and the one who predicts how lucky and happy the life of the baby will be. The second Fate is Death, the keeper of the Thread of Life and she predicts how long the life of the little human will be. And finally, the third Fate is Destiny, tiny and cute, this fairy always tries to balance the previous two predictions so the baby can enjoy a beautiful life.
